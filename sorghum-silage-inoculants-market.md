<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sorghum Silage Inoculants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heterofermentative</li><li>Homofermentative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sorghum silage inoculants are classified into two main types based on their fermentation processes: heterofermentative and homofermentative. Heterofermentative inoculants produce a variety of fermentation products, including lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide, which help improve silage stability and palatability. In contrast, homofermentative inoculants primarily yield lactic acid, resulting in rapid acidification and enhanced preservation of nutrients. The choice between these types depends on the desired silage characteristics and specific fermentation goals for livestock feed optimization.</p></p>
